# ClickyGame

## Overview

This application is a memory game built using React. In particular, the application's user interface has been broken into components, has a managed component state, and also responds to user events.

### Notes

1. This application is based upon the [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/).

2. In order to create the app, you must create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

3. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

4. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if the user clicks the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page are shuffled in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

7. This application is deployed to Github Pages. (See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.)
